WormCount
=========
Evaluates images of a plate of worms and estimates the number of worms present.
Calcualtes the chemotaxis index of experiments.

Usage
=====
Ensure that the count_worms_vX.X directory is in your MATLAB PATH.

Count worms for entire experiment (directory)
SQUARE GRID PLATES


Count worms for an entire experiment (directory)
================================================

Square Grid Plates (BETA)
------------------
count_data = count_worms_directory_grid() allows gui
   selection of the directory to analyze.  The directory must contain
   sets of whole plate images for each strain, time point, and
   replicate. File names must conform for the following specification:

       [strain]_T[time]_[replicate].png

Round Plates
------------
count_data = count_worms_directory() allows gui
   selection of the directory to analyze.  The directory must contain
   sets of whole plate images for each strain, time point, and
   replicate. File names must conform for the following specification:

       [strain]_T[time]_[replicate].png


Calculate cheomotaxis index
----------------------------   
chemotaxis_data = chemotaxis_index(count_data)

    count_data is a struct with four fields:
        total, ori, but, eth

    CHEMOTAXIS_INDEX = (but-eth)/(total-ori)
